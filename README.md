## Description
![SC](./photos/SC.png)
I have developed a user-friendly text editor application that offers seamless functionality in both online and offline environments. To guarantee data persistence and prevent any loss, I have implemented multiple data storage options within the application. 

This text editor application aims to enhance users productivity and creativity. It serves as a versatile platform where developers can easily organize their thoughts, experiment with code, and quickly iterate on their ideas. Whether online or offline, this application serves as a valuable resource to empower developers throughout their coding journey.
